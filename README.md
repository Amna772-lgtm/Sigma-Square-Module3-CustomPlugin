#Custom Todo List Plugin
A comprehensive WordPress plugin for managing personal tasks and to-do lists with user registration and login functionalities.

#Motivation
As an intern at a software house, I was assigned a task to develop a custom WordPress plugin as part of my training in plugin development. This project provided an opportunity to dive deep into WordPress's extensive plugin architecture, enhance my skills in PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL, and contribute to a real-world application. The goal was to create a functional and user-friendly todo list plugin that allows users to manage tasks efficiently, with the added challenge of implementing secure user registration and login features. This experience not only strengthened my technical capabilities but also gave me valuable insights into the development process within a professional environment.

##Code Style
This plugin follows standard WordPress coding practices to ensure readability, maintainability, and compatibility with other WordPress plugins and themes. Key aspects of the code style include:

- **PHP Coding Standards:** All PHP code is written following the [WordPress PHP Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/). This includes proper indentation, naming conventions, and documentation.

- **HTML & CSS:** The HTML structure adheres to semantic HTML5 standards, and CSS is organized using a modular approach. CSS naming follows the [BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)](http://getbem.com/introduction/) methodology where appropriate.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is written following the [WordPress JavaScript Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/). jQuery is used for DOM manipulation, and care is taken to avoid conflicts with other plugins.

- **Security Best Practices:** The plugin code is written with security in mind, including proper data sanitization, validation, and escaping to prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS.
